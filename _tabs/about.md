i'm currently a cs major at the National University of Singapore (NUS)!

in my free time, i like to play ctfs and build random things. 

### Work Experience 
i was a IT intern at V-key for 7 months -- i built some cool SSL certificate renewal script using Ansible and did some awesome iOS mobile security research here. it was so fun that i ended up part-timing for them for another 5 months!
